Guzzle Stopwatch Middleware
===========================

This is a takeover drop-in fork of https://github.com/csarrazi/guzzle-stopwatch-middleware which seems to be abandoned.  
We left the namespace as `Csa` to assure drop-in replacement.

Installation
------------

```
composer req freshcells/guzzle-stopwatch-middleware
```

-------

Although I try to guarantee forward-compatibility of the bundle with previous versions.
Here are the upgrade notes between each version.
